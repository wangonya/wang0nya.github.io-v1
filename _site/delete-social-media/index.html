      <p>I’ve always felt like social media was taking up a little bit too much of my time, but as a freelance dev just starting out, I felt like I needed it. How would I get my work out there? How would I make connections with other developers? How would I get clients? All these were reasons that made me (somewhat reluctantly) maintain my presence on the various social platforms… until I read “Deep Work” by Cal Newport.</p>

<p><img src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sypjq6sbks2c2p7l4zub.jpg" alt="meaningful communication" /></p>

<p>This isn’t meant to be a book review, so I’ll get right to the point. Cal argues that in order to achieve Deep Work, one has to be in a state of minimal distraction, and he proposes taking a break from social media. Now, it’s natural to be immediately skeptical of this, but this is what convinced me:</p>

<h2 id="so-this-is-why-i-deleted-facebook-twitter-and-instagram">So, this is why I deleted Facebook, Twitter and Instagram…</h2>
<p>If you’re like me, you may have the very same reasons I did of sticking around on the popular social platforms. But do you <strong><em>really</em></strong> need them? How can you be sure? Answer: perform an honest cost-benefit analysis of all the social media platforms in your life, and quit all services that don’t provide <strong>substantially</strong> more benefits than costs with respect to things you truly value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The average user now spends almost two hours per day on social media — at best a small fraction of this time is dedicated to the “important” reasons most would list when asked why they need to use these services.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was true for me. I found that the reasons that were making me keep using these tools weren’t even the main reasons I woke up everyday and the first thing I did was check my phone. I wasn’t checking to see if a client had reached out, I was checking to see if I got a new follower, or if my picture got more likes.</p>

<h2 id="and-turned-to-devto">…and turned to Dev.to</h2>

<p>I figured… if my dev career is the only thing that was keeping me on those tools, then there’s a better place to do that. A place that’s specifically meant for that, free from all the other distractions. I’d joined <a href="https://dev.to/wangonya">dev.to</a> earlier this year, but I wasn’t really very active, until recently.</p>

<p>This can be really humbling because, unlike on facebook or twitter, people on dev.to pretend to care about what you have to say (by clicking “like” or leaving a quick comment), so that you can do the same for them when they post something too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wouldn’t say this is entirely true. I’d definitely encourage folks to leave quick encouraging comments and use the reactions in encouraging ways, but I know what you mean in terms of it not being purely a matter of feeding the addictive cycle of social approval. -A note from Dev.to creator Ben Halpern :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only way I can truly gain people’s attention is by giving out something worth someone’s time, something meaningful. This’ll push me to work harder, do more… not for the attention, but to improve as a developer, and in the spirit of open sharing of information – using the internet like it was meant to be used: embracing the social internet over social media.</p>

<h2 id="1-month-slow-social-media-challenge">1 month slow social media challenge</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Only use a given social media service if it provides valuable benefits that would be hard to replace. Use these services <em>only</em> for these purposes.</li>
  <li>Delete all social media apps from your phone. (Few serious uses for social media require that you can access it wherever you are throughout the day.) Instead, access social media through a web browser on your laptop or desktop, once or twice a week.</li>
  <li>When logged onto a social media service, don’t click “like” or follow links unrelated to your specific, high-value purposes — these activities mainly serve the social media conglomerate’s attempts to package you into data slivers that they can sell to the highest bidder.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adding these restrictions has the benefit of clarifying the true value of the activities that keep you in the social media orbit. If you find that the extra obstacle of using a web browser instead of your phone prevents you from using a given service for more than a month, than you should quit it altogether.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(You’ll be surprised how much free time you’ll have, and you might find after this challenge, like I did, that most of the stories you have told yourself about social media’s importance to your existence are more fictional than you  realize.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’ve had a more fulfilling time on <a href="https://dev.to/wangonya">dev.to</a> than I’ve had in a long time on facebook, twitter or instagram. I do realize though, that people are different and not everyone may agree with my thoughts, and that’s totally cool. If your benefits substantially outweigh the costs, then by all means, do what you must. Just sharing my experience here 🙂</p>

<p>I highly recommend Cal’s book “Deep Work”, and his <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">blog</a> which actually inspired me to write this post</p>
