description: This is a demo website I built for Cars & Chrome Club of Kenya. The website gives an overview of what the club is about and showcases their gallery of cars. It also has a login section for members. The PHP sections of the site are hidden as they cannot be viewed under the current hosting circumstances. Once proper hosting is set up, the site will be fully functional.
