>“The human brain’s capacity doesn’t change from one year to the next, so the insights from studying human behaviour have a very long shelf life. What was difficult for users twenty years ago continues to be difficult today.” - Jakob Nielsen

Don’t Make Me Think! was first published 18 years ago, and if you're just hearing about it now, it's tempting to think: "Is it still relevant?" Well, yes.

Despite the fact that it's been updated (we'll be going through the latest edition -- Don’t Make Me Think, Revisited), the purpose of the book remains the same from the time it was first published until the latest edition -- helping designers and developers build great, usable designs for stuff that users interact with.

As Krug puts it, the basic principles are the same even if the landscape has changed, because **usability is about people and how they understand and use things, not about technology. And while technology often changes quickly, people change very slowly.**

Join me tomorrow as we get into the book's first chapter and explore Krug's first law of usability: Don't make me think!
