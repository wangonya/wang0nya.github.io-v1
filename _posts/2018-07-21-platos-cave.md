description: Plato's allegory of the cave
---

Now, I'm not a philosopher, not by a long shot. But I do read widely, and I came across an interesting allegory
Plato presents in his work <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30289.The_Republic" target="_blank">Republic</a>. 
It has come to be known as **The allegory of the cave**, and goes something like this:
<div class="breaker"></div>
There are people (let's call them prisoners) living in a cave. They have lived there since childhood shackled by the legs and neck and know nothing of the outside world.
Thus they stay in the same place so that there
is only one thing for them to look at: whatever they encounter in front of their faces. Because they are
shackled, they are unable to turn their heads around. 

As you would expect, there are no windows in the cave so it is dump and dark. There is, however, a fire that casts its glow toward
them from behind them, being above and at some distance. Between the fire and the prisoners (i.e., behind their backs) there runs 
a walkway at a certain height. Occasionally, people pass through this walkway carrying all sorts of things - statues and other carvings 
made of stone or wood and many other artifacts that people have made. Shadows of these passing people and artifacts are cast upon the wall that these
prisoners face. Being unable to turn and look behind them, the prisoners perceive these shadows to be the reality and even name and classify them.
They see nothing else besides the shadows that are continually projected on the wall opposite them by the glow of the fire.

By chance, one of the prisoners is able to escape and find a way out of the cave into the open. Ever been asleep and had someone suddenly shine a light in
your eyes? The sunlight hurts his eyes and it takes time to adjust to the brightness. Once he is able to see clearly...

He sees that there are actually **_real_** things, and that the shadows are just mere reflections of those things. The shadows appeared much clearer 
to him because they were all he'd knew since childhood. Before, he had only seen shadows of people, animals, plants and artifacts.
Now he sees the real objects, and their shadows as cast by the light of the sun.  
>_“Illuminated and enlightened, he observes the vastness and sublimeness of the universe. 
Previously he had been looking merely at phantoms; now he is nearer to the true nature of being.” -Plato_

The prisoner returns to the cave to share his discovery but is no longer used to the darkness and has a hard time finding his way around the cave and seeing the shadows on the wall. The 
other prisoners tell him that it was a waste of time going to "the upper world", and that it has made him stupid and blind, since he is now unable 
to comprehend what he knew so well before he left: the shadows. He seems to the others totally foolish, while he in turn is unimpressed by them. 
They refuse to listen to what he has to say, resist any attempts to get free, and even plot to kill him.

Plato says that the object of the allegory is to compare "the effect of education (an enlightening experience) and the lack of it on our nature".
It shows that most people are not just comfortable in their ignorance, but hostile to anyone that points it out. All of us have been there. We think 
we _know_ what we think we know, but is what we think we know to be reality really reality or are we like the prisoners, because of our environment, upbringing, education, religion, 
culture -- our caves and shackles -- just seeing shadows and taking them to be reality since its all we've ever seen, and all we **_can_** see?

How many times do you argue with people trying to convince them of something contrary to what they've always known to be true? Yeah, you're already picturing 
that guy or group of people to whom you were speaking to. But remember that time you were part of that group of stiff-necks and could'nt take what that other person was saying?
You may think you're out of the cave but you're just in another cave. The question is, who's really out of every cave?﻿
How about always keeping an open mind? :)
