With web development getting more and more popular by the day thanks to the massive influx of javascript frameworks and design tools, I think it's important not to loose track of one important area: web usability.

Simply put, web usability is the ease of use of a website. Your web or mobile app may work great, but if it isn't easy to use, people just won't use it.

According to [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/1669283/dollars-and-sense-the-business-case-for-investing-in-ui-design), usability is a must-have for optimal return on investment with new technologies. Companies focusing on user-experience (UX) and user-interface design in product and application development create better solutions, improving revenue, loyalty, and market share. Apple has shown that consumers are willing to pay a premium for products that are easy to use.

>**Numerous industry studies have stated that every dollar spent on UX brings in between $2 and $100 dollars in return.**

So, with all this in mind, I'm beginning a series today, going through Steve Krug's classic - "Donâ€™t Make Me Think! A common sense approach to web usability". I'll be posting a summary of each of the 12 chapters of the book here, one chapter a day.

Stay tuned, we'll be building a better web one day at a time for the next 12 days!
