description: How we make life hard for ourselves

Once as the Athenian general Pericles led a fleet of ships during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War" target="_blank">Peloponnesian War</a>, 
the sun was eclipsed and his 150 ships were cast into darkness. Surprised by this unexpected and confusing event, not to mention believing it 
to be a bad omen sent from the gods, his men were thrown into a state of panic. 

Unlike the crew though, Pericles was undaunted. He walked up to a lead steersman, removed the cloak he was wearing, and held it up around the man's face. 
He then asked, "Are you afraid of the darkness now?" 

No, of course not.

"So what does it matter", Pericles replied, "when the cause of the darkness differs?"

I just finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24615.Enchiridion" target="_blank">Enchiridion</a> by Epictetus, and the main thing I came away with was that: 
we cannot always have complete control over situations in our lives, but we do have control over how we view them, and how we let them affect us. 
This is why people in some of the poorest parts of the world seem happier than those in the wealthiest nations.

Simply put:
* Things are not what they are; they are what we think they are
* Things are what we compare them to

As Ryan Holiday explains in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18668059-the-obstacle-is-the-way" target="_blank">The Obstacle Is The Way</a>, 
Perspective is everything. Things usually lose their power over us when we break them apart and look at them from new angles.

Fear is debilitating, distracting, tiring, and often irrational. Pericles understood this, and he was able to use the power of perspective to defeat it.
We often choose the ominous explanation over the simple one, to our detriment. The task, as Pericles showed, is not to ignore the fear, but to explain it away.

Remember, we choose how we look at things. We retain the ability to inject perspective into a situation. We can't change the obstacles themselves -- that part 
of the equation is set -- but the power of perspective can change how the obstacles appear. How we approach, view, and contextualize an obstacle, and what we tell ourselves it means, 
determines how daunting and trying it will be to overcome.

but the choices I make with regard to them I do control. Where will I find good and bad? In me, in my choices.” -Epictetus_
