Hi there! I'm Kinyanjui Wangonya. 

I enjoy <a href="https://github.com/wang0nya" target="_blank">developing web and mobile applications</a>, <a href="https://500px.com/wangonya" target="_blank">capturing moments</a>, 
and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/wangonya" target="_blank">reading</a>. I also (occasionally) write about stuff I've read/experienced (or just anything really) on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.

Other interests include art, poetry and music.

**Oh, and I'm looking for work! :) <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E8-w9lOBE8Ef4mACMdcHb0XUFuHT3JKa/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Here's my CV </a>**
