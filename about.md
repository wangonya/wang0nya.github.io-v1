I enjoy developing web and mobile applications (focus on front-end), capturing moments, and reading. <a href="/books">(See my reading list for this year)</a>

I also (occasionally) write about stuff I've read/experienced (or just anything really) on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.

Other interests include art, poetry and music.
