      <description>Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 as a new syntax for writing Javascript functions. Thanks to their short syntax, they encourage the use of small functions, which make code look cleaner (and () =&amp;gt; just looks cooler ðŸ˜„).
As a beginner just getting to wrap my head around ES6 syntax, I began using arrow functions everywhere without really understanding how they worked. As you might expect, I ended up running into some problems, especially with the this keyword.</description>
